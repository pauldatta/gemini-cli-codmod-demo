# Gemini CLI [`codmod`](https://cloud.google.com/migration-center/docs/app-modernization-assessment) Demo

This repository demonstrates how to use the [`codmod`](https://cloud.google.com/migration-center/docs/app-modernization-assessment) tool and Gemini CLI to plan the modernization of a Java application.

## About this Demo

This demo showcases a workflow for modernizing the classic [Spring PetClinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) application. It uses [`codmod`](https://cloud.google.com/migration-center/docs/app-modernization-assessment) to generate an initial assessment report and then uses the Gemini CLI to create a detailed migration plan.

## Files in this Repository

- `CODMOD.md`: A detailed guide on how to use the [`codmod`](https://cloud.google.com/migration-center/docs/app-modernization-assessment) tool.
- `PLAN.md`: The detailed migration plan for the Spring PetClinic application.
- `spring-petclinic-java-mod.md`: The initial modernization assessment report for the Spring PetClinic application, generated by [`codmod`](https://cloud.google.com/migration-center/docs/app-modernization-assessment).
- `setup_codmod.sh`: A script to install the [`codmod`](https://cloud.google.com/migration-center/docs/app-modernization-assessment) tool.

## Modernization Context

The `PLAN.md` file, which outlines the detailed migration strategy, was generated based on the insights and recommendations provided in the `spring-petclinic-java-mod.md` assessment report. This report was automatically produced by the [`codmod`](https://cloud.google.com/migration-center/docs/app-modernization-assessment) tool, demonstrating its capability to provide a foundational analysis for modernization efforts.

## How to Use this Repository

1.  **Explore the [`codmod`](https://cloud.google.com/migration-center/docs/app-modernization-assessment) tool:** Read `CODMOD.md` to understand the capabilities of [`codmod`](https://cloud.google.com/migration-center/docs/app-modernization-assessment).
2.  **Review the assessment report:** Examine `spring-petclinic-java-mod.md` to see the initial findings from the `codmod` tool.
3.  **Understand the migration plan:** Read `PLAN.md` to see how the initial assessment is translated into a detailed, actionable migration plan.

This repository serves as a reference for how you can use [`codmod`](https://cloud.google.com/migration-center/docs/app-modernization-assessment) and the Gemini CLI to accelerate your application modernization journey.

## Next Steps

Based on the detailed `PLAN.md`, you can leverage the Gemini CLI or Jules to automate and perform the outlined migration tasks. This can significantly accelerate the modernization process by translating the plan into actionable steps and code modifications.
